Job info scraping
This project aims to provide a simple web scraping script that retrieves job search information from www.timesjobs.com and presents it to the user. By automating the data retrieval process, users can easily obtain relevant job listings without manually browsing through the website.

The script prompts the user to enter their desired job title. It then sends a request to TimesJobs with the provided parameters and extracts job information from the search results page. The extracted data includes job titles, company names, locations, and job descriptions.

The project utilizes Python and popular web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests. It handles errors gracefully and provides clear instructions for the user. The extracted job information is presented in a readable format, either by printing it to the console or generating a report in a specific format.

You need to install the required libraries to run this file.
